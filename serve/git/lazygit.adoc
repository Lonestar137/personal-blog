= Lazygit

Using Lazygit as a replacement for GitK.

== Viewing and Diffing branches
Navigate to the 3rd pane, the branches pane, and highlight a branch. Press 'Shift+W' and select 'Diff {branch name}', then move up and highlight the branch you want to view as the current branch view.  You will now see the diff between the branches.

=== Viewing and Diffing remote branches
The only difference is that you hit '[' on the branches panel until you see
'origin' appear and then you can hit enter and select from remote branches.


=== Viewing diff filetree
On the highlighted branch, hit enter and then hit enter on the commit, from there it will show the modified file tree between the branches.
